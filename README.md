# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package in Python. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to classify text data into different sentiment categories. This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using NLTK, a powerful library for text processing and analysis in Python.
# Objective 
The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below.
-Data Extraction: Input.xlsx: For each of the articles, given in the input.xlsx file, extract the article text and save the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name. While extracting text, please make sure your program extracts only the article title and the article text. It should not extract the website header, footer, or anything other than the article text.

##### NOTE: YOU MUST USE PYTHON PROGRAMMING TO EXTRACT DATA FROM THE URLs. YOU CAN USE BEATIFULSOUP, SELENIUM OR SCRAPY, OR ANY OTHER PYTHON LIBRARIES THAT YOU PREFER FOR DATA CRAWLING.

Data Analysis For each of the extracted texts from the article, perform textual analysis and compute variables, given in the output structure Excel file. 

The definition of each variable is given in the “Text Analysis.docx” file. Look for these variables in the analysis document 

(Text Analysis.docx): POSITIVE SCORE NEGATIVE SCORE POLARITY SCORE SUBJECTIVITY SCORE AVG SENTENCE LENGTH PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS FOG INDEX AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE COMPLEX WORD COUNT WORD COUNT SYLLABLE PER WORD PERSONAL PRONOUNS AVG WORD LENGTH
